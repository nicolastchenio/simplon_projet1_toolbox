## Overview

**Python Toolbox** is a small modular Python project designed to demonstrate good software engineering practices:

- modular Python architecture
- unit testing with Pytest
- code coverage measurement with pytest-cov
- static code analysis with Ruff
- dependency management with uv
- CI/CD integration

The application reads a CSV file describing mathematical operations and executes them using a dedicated business logic module.

This repository is structured to follow professional Python project standards used in modern data and MLOps environments.

## Installation

This project uses **uv** for dependency management and environment synchronization.

### 1. Install uv

```
pip install uv
```

### 2. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/USER/REPO.git

cd REPO
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```
uv sync
```

This command will:

- create the virtual environment
- install all dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml`
- synchronize the environment with the project configuration

---

## Running the Application
```
uv run python -m app.main
```
---

## Running Tests

Execute the test suite with:
```
uv run pytest
```

To run tests with coverage:

```
uv run pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
```

## Code Quality

This project uses **Ruff** for linting and code quality checks.

Run linting with

```
uv run ruff check .
```


---

## Continuous Integration

The project integrates a CI pipeline that automatically:

- runs tests
- checks code coverage
- performs linting

The CI status badge at the top of this README reflects the latest build status.
